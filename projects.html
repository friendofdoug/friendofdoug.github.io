            <h3>Boston Area Wine Events</h3>
            <p>
                I've been trying to get more into the wine world this year, and one of the most important steps I've taken is trying to go to more tastings.
                Creating this calendar with a bunch of events near me has been so helpful in lowering the barrier to action. Now, when I have some free time I can quickly check
                this calendar and find an awesome new event to attend where I can expand my palate and my knowledge! I hope others can get some use out of it, too.
            </p>

            </p>
                I also am including a simple feedback form below if anyone is interested in giving feedback. I welcome any positive or constructive comments, requests to add or remove events,
                and suggestions for other things people may want to see, just let me know! I'll do my best to honor requests and respond to messages.
