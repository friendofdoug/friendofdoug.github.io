            <h3>Boston Area Wine Events â€” 4/8/2025</h3>
            <p>
                I've been trying to get more into the wine world this year, and one of the most important steps I've taken is trying to go to more tastings.
                Creating this calendar with a bunch of events near me has been so helpful in lowering the barrier to action. Now, when I have some free time I can quickly check
                this calendar and find an awesome new event to attend where I can expand my palate and my knowledge! I hope others can get some use out of it, too.
            </p>
            </p>
            <iframe src="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=945c2b3d3cd9924264895578fd0c084cf2af6edc3935ef381222e109fcfa98d5%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FNew_York" style="border: 0" width="800" height="600" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
            </p>
                I also am including a simple feedback form below if anyone is interested in giving feedback. I welcome any positive or constructive comments, requests to add or remove events,
                and suggestions for other things people may want to see, just let me know! I'll do my best to honor requests and respond to messages. Also, note that I do manually add events, so
                it can take some time to add things. It also may mean that if I take a break from this project it might get more sparse or out of date, so make sure to double check if the calendar
                hasn't been updated in a little while! I'll keep an update log here, as well.
                LAST UPDATE: 4/8/2025

            <h3>Word & Character Counter â€” 4/8/2025</h3>
              <p>To be honest, I'm not sure why I made this. It showed up in my to-create list in my Notes App (although I don't
                  remember putting it there), so I decided maybe past me was trying to offer me some wisdom in trying to make this.
                  It's basically a simple live counter tool with word and character goals that's perfect for writing or editing your work.
                  I hope it can be there for you throughout all your writing endeavors!</p>
